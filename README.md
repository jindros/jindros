## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have been out of professional programming for some time, especially web development. 
My repositories serve as a catch-up with the latest technologies.
These projects are in development, I will be programming and pushing new code _almost every day_.

### Repeated meetings
__tech stack:__ .NET 8, REST API, Entity framework, MS SQL, I will probably try a couple of different frontends (React, Vue, Blazor).
> Track attendance at recurring events - for example, a sports team with weekly training sessions.

âš¡ more coming soon âš¡
