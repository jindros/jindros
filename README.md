## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I was for some time outside of the professional programming. especially web development. 
My repositories serve as a catch-up with the newest technologies.
I will program and push new code _almost every day_.

### Repeated meetings
tracking of attendandts of recurring events - for example for our floorball team
.NET 8, REST APIs, I will probably try couple different front ends (React, Vue, Blazor)

âš¡ more coming soon âš¡
